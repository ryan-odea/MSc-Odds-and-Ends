# 3-7-3/7 
Calculate how many numbers between 1:1000 are divisible by 3, how many are not divisible by 7, and how many are divisible by both 3 and 7.

## Answer by Zyke
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

summarise(tibble(v = 1:1000),
  three            = sum(v %% 3 == 0),
  not_seven        = sum(v %% 7 != 0),
  three_and_seven  = sum(v %% 3 == 0 & v %% 7 == 0),
  three_nand_seven = sum(v %% 3 == 0 & v %% 7 != 0)
)
```
